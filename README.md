pig-latin-translator
====================

A simple string manipulation project written using Visual C# for an assignment. The user enters an English sentence and a 'Pig Latin' translation is produced. The method which actually does the conversion ended up being a little less elegant than I would have liked, but he project was worth very little in terms of grades so I didn't want to spend too much extra time on it.
